# roam-bib

A utility for generating "bibliography" pages for [roam](https://roamresearch.com), using arXiv metadata.

## Devnotes/TODO

- [ ] Add command-line arguments
  - [ ] Better ways of adding custom text
  - [ ] Adding custom titles
  - [ ] Custom output files
  - [ ] Choose how to handle duplicates
  - [ ] Choose how to format titles
- [ ] Web interface
- [ ] Command-line interface using titles/ids instead of files.
- [ ] Non-arXiv sources

Also need to do some major cleaning up of the code.

## Usage

Run the uberjar in a directory containg arXiv pdfs. `roambib.json` contains the resulting collection of roam pages.
